# Sumo-Robot
This is a collaborative project by Rishabh Kichu, Daniel Gigi George and Ryan Roshan Kuruvilla for the Shaastrotsav 2023 Sumo Wrestling Robot Competition.

## Design Phase
The design phase spanned several months, beginning in early August with extensive planning and prototyping. While we started with a general concept, much effort went into refining the details. We carefully identified the necessary components and strategized how and where to source them. An initial prototype was constructed using card stock after sketching, the second prototype was made out of a more solid wood. Once the software was completed, we intended to transition to a final version made from metal.

## Software Phase
A ring was printed out by seperating the actual ring used in the competition into smaller sections of a4 paper online and printing it out and then gluing them together. This was used to test out the light sensors of the sumo robot.
The software consisted of three parts: 

#### Light sensors and staying in the ring
#### Front uv sensor and detection of opponent robot
#### Right and left ir sensor and detection of opponent robot

This work was done mainly at home but we also worked on it together at school whenever we could, during lunch breaks or free periods. We encountered many problems with the tuning of the light sensors and adjusting the turning amount to fit the ring size. This was fixed by constant trial and error.
